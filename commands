sudo mkdir jenkins
sudo chmod 777 -R jenkins
cd jenkins
pwd ----> /home/ubuntu/jenkins (copy this root address)
#launch jenkins master node: IP address:8080 on your URL
#manage jenkins--> manage nodes--->new node---> fill in the ff (name| desc| No of executors| remote root directory:home/ubuntu/jenkins| usage:as much as possible| launch method: via SSH, host: IP address of slave, credentials: add, kind SSH Username with private key, username: ubuntu, Private key: copy and paste key PEM| host key verification strategy: Manually trusted key verification strategy
